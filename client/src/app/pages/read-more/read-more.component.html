        yourCareerFair offers unparalleled, free, search and screening functionality for both applicants and recruiters. Using standardized user inputs as well as proprietary machine learning and AI algorithms, this platform is capable of comprehensively assessing the estimated compatibility of any user and position pair in real-time for users to see and utilize. In addition, yourCareerFair leverages this algorithm in its search process, allowing for applicants and recruiters to search for positions and applicants based on, in part, qualification level estimates and other pertinent metrics. For those who prefer a more traditional search, yourCareerFair also allows for searches filtered on other variables such as required skills, education, and title. Our hope is that these utilities are effective at attenuating the pernicious effects of labor market inefficiency and at helping all people to find appropriate, engaging, and compatible employment.

        yourCareerFair provides additional free services on top of its search engine and qualification level estimate assessments. The application maintains free application management and applicant tracking system functionality for all users. It allows recruiters to save notes on applicants, immediately notifies applicants when a recruiter makes a decision and allows for bulk/one-click application submissions. In addition, yourCareerFair, as indicated by its name, allows for schools and institutions to host online and in-person career fairs using the site’s resources. This will hopefully encourage new practices for career fair interations which are more efficient and informative. As an example, a recruiter at a career fair, instead of accepting paper CVs, could simply have their candidates submit online applications to their position posting on yourCareerFair -- providing instantaneous access to the candidate's compatibility estimates, summary of work history, skills, and more -- this gives the recruiter valuable real time information as well as more time to focus on interviews and personal interactions.

    <h2> Research Disclaimer </h2>
    <p>
        Some information will be used, without loss of confidentiality to the individual user, to research, among other subject matters, the efficacy of electronic/internet-based market mediums at encouraging the formation of efficient market places. Further studies will also be conducted on information gathered via this system to deduce whether or not more potentially desirable Pareto efficient outcomes can be achieved via the use of similar applications. Put colloquially, this website serves the dual purpose of a research tool to determine whether or not an application/tool similar to this can be utilized to increase the social utility of an economic system without actually interfering directly or significantly with market interactions. In addition to research, this site will publish general information regarding the labor market as determined by this site. This information will include, but is not limited to, general unemployment rates, the average number of applications submitted per person, etc. The hope is to create an open research platform for labor economic, academic, and legislative research.
